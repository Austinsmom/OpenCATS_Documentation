Contacts Screen

The contacts screen is the main screen for dealing with contacts internally, from client companies, or leads in the sales process.  People on the hiring side, not candidates looking for work.

This is similar to the other screens.  No features here that have not been covered already.  We will move along.

Lists

Hot lists, Lead Lists, tear sheets, call lists.  Whatever you call them, most recruiters have used them at some point.  OpenCATs has them here.

The only new clickable button on the Lists screen is the ``Show Lists`` button in the upper right corner of the blue bar.

See "Working with Lists" section for more information (not yet written).
