Add a new Company
-----------------

Click on ``Companies``

.. note:: I have already entered some test information.  A new system screen will look a little different.

This is your main company screen.  This will have an overview of all the companies in your OpenCATS system.  From new leads, to active clients and old clients.  They will all be here.

.. note:: For internal hiring (your company), select ``Internal postings`` as the client.

Click on ``Add Company``

There are two ways to add information into OpenCATS.

* Copy and paste it into the box labelled ``cut and paste freeform address here``  Then clck the ``<--`` button to populate the fields. 
* Manually type and paste it into each field on the left.

.. note:: Don't forget to enter key technologies for the company and any miscellaneous notes that you want to save in the bottom two fields for future reference.

.. warning:: The success rate of auto-populating the information fields for me has always been terrible.  Sometimes it works great, sometimes it's doesn't.  I usually just enter the fields one at a time manually.

If it worked, it should look like this.  If some of the information did not populate, manually enter it and let's move one.

This is what you should see.



Click ``Add Company``
