What is this manual?

This manual explains how to use OpenCATS, the free open-source applicant tracking system (ATS). 

It describes how to install and configure OpenCATS, how recruiters can use it to manage their work, and how to customize and extend it.

Legal information/License FAQ
-----------------------------

**What license is OpenCATS distributed under?**

This License is based on the Mozilla Public License. 

**Can we change this license?**

No, the License remains as-is until the original developers change the license under which they released the code. Cognizo, who developed CATS are not changing the license - it will remain licensed under the CPL.

**What CAN we change?**

If there was a need, the project name and/or logo could be changed. We have for example changed the Project name to OpenCATS

**What are the key features of this license?**

There are some 'unique' requirements in Exhibit B;

* I) You may not use the Licensed Software to operate in or as a time-sharing, outsourcing, service bureau, application service provider or managed service provider environment.   
* II) The following copyright notice must be retained and clearly legible at the bottom of every rendered HTML document: Copyright (C) 2005 - 2006 Cognizo Technologies, Inc. All rights reserved.                     
* III) The "Powered by CATS" text or logo must be retained and clearly legible on every rendered HTML document. The logo, or the text "CATS", must be a hyperlink to the CATS Project website, currently http://www.catsone.com/.

**Is this an Open Source license?**

Sadly, Exhibit B I) restricts one of the freedoms required to be defined as Open Source. This means that although OpenCATS is free (as in beer) and the source is 'Open', it is not officially Open Source. This project does not have the rights to strip the appendix.

**So is everything subject to the CPL?**

Not entirely. A few examples;

integration into Joomla! In this case, Joomla is a completely separate GPL project, and the CATS module simply polls the backend MySQL databases for CATS. Whilst it does fall logically into the OpenCATS project, the CATS module remains Open Source.

Similarly, separate backend reporting packages could easily poll the same shared MySQL database.

**Simplify this for me, what can I do and what can't I do?**

Simply put, you can do anything you want with your OpenCATS system. The main thing you can NOT do is make money off of it.  You can not install it, host it, provide it as a service and get paid for it.  Don't make money off of it, that's a no-no.  The other things (cosmetic and linking) are specified in Section 2 and 3 above.
