Support
=======
The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the ``#crawler``
channel on Freenode.  We hang out there and you can get real-time help with your projects.

The other good way is to open an issue on `Github <http://github.com/example/crawler/issues>`_.

The mailing list at Crawler Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crawler 
is also available for support.
