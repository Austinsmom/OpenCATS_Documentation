Introduction
============

OpenCATS is a free and open source, full-featured, web-based applicant tracking system, or ATS. 
It helps you manage the complete recruitment life-cycle from business development through finalizing a placement. It manages a huge range of information for you, including:

* Candidate details, qualifications, resumes (C.V's), contact history
* Job orders details, associated contacts, and the candidate pipeline for each
* Multiple recruiters, sites, career portals, and much more

OpenCATS vs CATSOne vs "open source"
------------------------------------

OpenCATS is a free, open-source ATS. This means that there is no charge to install or to use it. 

* For software developers, this also means that you are free to modify or extend the OpenCATS software, and to participate as a member of its development community. 
* This also means that there is no help desk that you can call for support.

The origins of OpenCATS are in a commercial open-source development effort called CATS, which split
into two separate efforts:

* This open-source OpenCATS system: http://www.opencats.org
* The commercial CATS product: http://www.catsone.com

The commercial CATS product is a highly polished, professionally supported, hosted software service.

OpenCATS, on the other hand, has somewhat less functionality, is installed on your server(s), and is supported only by you -- with some help from the development community.

General Features
----------------

**Free!:**  OpenCATS is open source software.  Which means it is free (no cost) to use, and you are free to modify it in (almost) any way you want.  Seriously, if you can do it, get down into the code and change absolutely anything!  

**Support:** It also means support may be hard to find.  We have a community of people that are willing to help as much as possible though.

**It is easy:** OpenCATS has an easy to use, intuitive interface.  This means minimal training time for you and your recruiters.  The job portal has a simple search and application process that your candidates will get through easily.

**It's in the cloud:** OpenCATS can be in the cloud, on your local server, or simply on the computer you use every day.  The choice is yours.  You can use it from anywhere, so can your recruiting team.

**Website integration:** OpenCATS has a built-in job board that you can set up by simply checking a box.  Candidates will be able to view your openings, apply and upload their resume (C.V.) to your OpenCATS software.

**Candidate and client management:** From the first phone call to the last email.  OpenCATS will help you keep track of all the details, activities, records, contact numbers and keep your workflow managed.

**Ownership of data:** You own it.  It's yours.  You can control it and secure it however you want.  No need for your data to be on someone else's servers, unless that is how you choose to do it.

**Backup and restore:**  With a few clicks you can back up your entire OpenCATS ATS.  If you ever need to restore it, that's a simple process too.

**Reporting:** Generate reports on recruiting activity for a quick and accurate overview.
